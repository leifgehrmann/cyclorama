  <p>A panorama from Calton Hill was first exhibited at the Archers' Hall in Edinburgh from the 31st of January 1788, until the beginning of March. It was then moved to the New Assembly Rooms in Edinburgh New Town between March 6th and June 2nd.<a href="#citation1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Finally it was exhibited at 28 Haymarket in London on the 14th of March, 1789.<a href="#citation2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The original panorama no longer exists, but this watercolour painting is possibly a recreation of the original.</p>
  <p>The dimensions of this simulated panorama are not the same as the dimensions of the original panorama; the original had a much smaller diameter of 25 feet (7 meters).<a href="#citation3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> This simulation uses the same dimensions of the rotunda at Leicester Square, which has a diameter of 84 feet (25 meters), to demonstrate Robert Barker's desired vision.</p>
